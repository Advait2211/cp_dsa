# i dont remember what abstract classes are. i only remember them being classes where you define methods and variables, which are later overriden 
# so i will try to implement that, correct me whereever i am wrong

class Person:
    category = str()

    def education(self):
        pass
    
    def social(self):
        pass


class Student(Person):
    pass

# okay i was trying to just create an abstract class but i don't know what ABC is so i will move to next question
